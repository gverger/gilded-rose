# A python test: The GildedRose Kata

The python code is taken from Emily Bache's [GildedRose Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

Read the [french requirements](./GildedRoseRequirements_fr.md), check [the code](./gildedrose/gilded_rose.py) and start thinking about how you
want to approach this problem.

The main point here is to *communicate* what you are about to do.

## Installation

The only dependency here is to pytest, use pipenv, poetry or no virtual env.
